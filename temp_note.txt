Great! I can see the pattern. Now I'll create a uniformstandard success screen component that can be reused across all 3 levels. Based on the reference image, I need:

1. Green border (border-green-500)
2. "MISSION ACCOMPLISHED" header stamp
3. Circular icon with rocket and star
4. "ORBIT ACHIEVED" title  
5. Description text
6. Stats table (2x2 grid)
7. Green "RETRY LEVEL" button
8. Blue "NEXT LEVEL" button

Let me update all three levels to have this consistent success screen.
